# FIX IT
## EX 05
In this exercise we want every word in a title to start with a capital letter.
* Look at the error message in the dev tools and fix it.
* Look at the documentation of split().
* Look at the documentation of charAt().
* Look at the documentation of slice().
* Adjust the function to get the desired result



* Chrome: F12 > Settings (gear icon) > Preferences > Sources > "Enable JavaScript source maps" (untick), "Enable CSS source maps (untick)

* split() - splits string into a new array without altering the originial

* charAt() - character position in string

* slice() - slices string into characters, var.slice(start character#, end character# )

* lines 28, 31, 36 - console.logs removed   (commented out, would delete IRL)
